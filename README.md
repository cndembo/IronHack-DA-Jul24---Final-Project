### Final Project - ML Creditworthiness Train Prediction

Credit scoring models allow lenders to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals and organizations and ensure that their exposure to liability is manageable. 

This allows lenders to assess the level of risk in their loan portfolio.

The aim of this code is to mimic the intelligent system that segregates clients into “credit score”, based on their bank details and credit-related information and predict if it's safe or unsafe to lend money to the prospector, despite of it's credit score .

This feature intends to reduce the manual efforts of analysis and accelerate the credit feedback to clients.
